# Collabora CODE

This is an example configuration of how to use [Collabora CODE](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/code/) with caddy.

Collabora can then be used with, for exmaple, [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/).

Note: In this example file Collabora CODE is started using its [official docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/collabora/code/) and reachable in the internal network using https://collabora:9980.
